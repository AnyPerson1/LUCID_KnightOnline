# LUCID — A Macro Manager for Knight Online

Hey.

This is **LUCID**, a macro manager built specifically for Knight Online. Lightweight, modular, and just smart enough to make your life easier — without turning into a bloated mess.

I built this mostly because I was tired of trash tools. So I wrote my own — less bullshit, more control.

### 🧠 Features

* Clean GUI (no, not some cursed WinForms from 2005)
* A secret ingredient to make my opponents angry :D
* Adjustable delays, auto combo, skill logic
* Runs smooth, feels native
* Logs everything (not in a creepy way... okay, maybe a little)
* Zero third-party spyware — because trust still matters
* And the fun part: **voice control**
  Yep, I built an AI for that. Just because I could.

---

### 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: C# (.NET)
* **Core**: C (compiled as DLL)
* **Interop**: Manual wrapper with DllImport
* **Build IDE**: Visual Studio 2022 (if that matters — I don’t think it does)
* Also includes optional inline assembly chaos. Why? Because... why not.

---

### ❓ Why Use It

Because you want something that just works. No drama. No pop-ups. No weird installers. You run it, set it up, and forget it.

I use it myself every time I log into KO. So yeah — this ain't some half-assed hobby project. It's built to last.

### 📦 Status

* Still in active development
* Currently used on **EUROKO Knight Online** server
* New features? Only if they actually matter. No hype crap.

### ☠️ About so_you_have_chosen_death.exe

Yeah… that file.

Let’s just say it’s a debugger deterrent. On the surface, it fills and dumps memory in cycles until the machine crashes with a virtual overflow error. Not exactly lethal — but let’s just say it “gently encourages” people to mind their own business.

Do not run it.
Unless you really want to experience what RAM abuse looks like.

### 🗿 Final Words

I'm not a company. Just some guy who codes too much and plays KO at 3AM.

If you’ve got feedback, bugs, cursed edge cases, or just wanna talk about macros — I’m around.

"It works for me." – me
