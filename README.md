# LUCID — A Macro Manager for Knight Online

Hey.

This is **LUCID**, a macro manager built specifically for Knight Online.  
Lightweight, modular, and just smart enough to make your life easier without turning into a bloated mess.

I built this mostly because I was tired of trash tools.  
So I wrote my own — less bullshit, more control.

## 🧠 Features

- Clean GUI (no, not some cursed WinForms from 2005)
- A secret ingredient to drive opponents insane 😈
- Adjustable delays, auto combo, skill logic
- Runs smooth, feels native
- Logs everything (but not in a creepy way... okay, maybe a little)
- Zero third-party spyware — because trust still matters
- And the fun part: **voice control**.  
  Yeah, I made an AI for that, just because I could.

## 🔧 Technologies

```c++
Frontend   → C# (.NET)  
Core       → C (compiled as DLL)  
Interop    → Manual wrapper with DllImport  
Build IDE  → Visual Studio 2022 (if that matters — I don’t think it does)
```

Bonus: optional inline assembly chaos included, because why not.

Why use it❓ 
Because you want something that just works —
No drama. No pop-ups. No weird installers.
You run it, set it up, and forget it.

I use it myself every time I log into KO.
So yeah — this ain't some abandoned hobby project. It's built to last.

📦 Status
Still in active development

Currently used on [EUROKO] Knight Online server

Features get added based on need, not hype

Final Words 🗿
I’m not a company.
Just some guy who codes too much and plays KO at 3AM.
If you’ve got feedback, bugs, or cursed edge cases — I’m down to chat.

"It works for me."
  – me
